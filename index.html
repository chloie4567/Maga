            <h3>What I have learned</h3>
            <p>For this portfolio page, I will be sharing what I have learned about web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and both front-end and back-end development. During our laboratory sessions, our instructor explained that HTML provides the structure of a website by allowing us to add text, images, links, and other essential content. CSS is used to style the website, helping us control colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, backgrounds, and the overall visual design. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior, such as animations, buttons, form validation, and other features that make a webpage more engaging for users. I also learned the difference between front-end development, which focuses on everything users see and interact with, and back-end development, which works behind the scenes to manage data, servers, and website functionality. In addition to these concepts, I practiced adding pictures, changing background colors, and modifying fonts to make a website look more appealing. Overall, these lessons helped me understand how websites are built—from their structure and design to their interactive elements and internal processes.</p>
